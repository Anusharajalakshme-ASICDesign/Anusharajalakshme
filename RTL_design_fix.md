<summary><b>⚡ High-Yield PPA Optimization </b></summary>

* **Situation:** A high-performance PSoC family required extreme power efficiency for real-time IoT and machine learning applications.
* **Task:** As the SoC Integrator, I was responsible for reducing dynamic power consumption while maintaining performance across complex power domains.
* **Action:** Implemented advanced low-power design techniques and modular RTL refactoring, segregating the design into standalone IPs with independent power formats.
* **Result:** Achieved a **20% reduction in dynamic power consumption** and increased design configuration flexibility by **60%**.
* **Impact:** **Delivered industry-leading power efficiency** for the product line and enabled a **60% improvement in design reusability** for future derivative SoCs.
* **Takeaway:** Strategic modularization of RTL not only solves immediate PPA targets but creates a long-term "design for reusability" framework that accelerates future product cycles.

<summary><b>🔐 Secure Boot OTP Memory Optimization </b></summary>

* **Situation:** The One-Time Programmable (OTP) was inefficiently re-reading entire protected security regions (containing public/private keys) every time firmware (FW) initiated operations after power-up, causing significant boot latency.
* **Task:** Implement a more efficient locking feature and hardware-read flow to enable secure boot while ensuring protected regions remained non-modifiable once locked.
* **Action:** Orchestrated the hardware state machine to implement a status check at a specific memory location. This triggered a single-run read sequence to latch values locally before handing control to the software.
* **Result:** Successfully eliminated redundant hardware reads, allowing the firmware to operate without hardware intervention for OTP memory operations post-boot.
* **Impact:** **Streamlined the secure boot sequence** and enhanced system reliability by ensuring hardware-level protection of sensitive keys while reducing overall power-up latency.
* **Takeaway:** Implementing hardware-level data update is a critical structural solution for optimizing the interaction between firmware and secure hardware resources.

<summary><b>🚦 Multi-Master Bus Arbitration Priority Optimization </b></summary>

* **Situation:** During high-concurrency multitasking, a collision occurred between two bus masters—the MIPS DS (Data Stream) and the AES master—while writing to the AES FIFO via DMA. 
* **Task:** Resolve a bus matrix deadlock where the default fixed-priority arbitration gave higher precedence to the MIPS DS, effectively blocking critical DMA access during security operations.
* **Action:** Designed and implemented a programmable arbitration register. This allowed the system to dynamically reconfigure priority levels, ensuring DMA access was prioritized after the initial security register configuration.
* **Result:** Successfully identified and resolved the bottleneck during post-silicon validation, with the fix integrated into the final production silicon.
* [cite_start]**Impact:** **Eliminated system-level deadlocks** during multi-tasking and provided architectural flexibility for firmware to tune bus performance based on real-time security workloads.
* [cite_start]**Takeaway:** Static arbitration is often insufficient for complex SoCs; implementing programmable priority registers is essential for robust, "deadlock-proof" multi-master designs.
